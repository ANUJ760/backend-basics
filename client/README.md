# Client (React)

This frontend is intentionally simple to keep focus on backend learning.

## What this client does

- Register and login users
- Save JWT token in localStorage
- Create/read/update/delete todos
- Send token in API requests

## Important Beginner Notes

- React components are reusable UI blocks.
- `components/` folder is created manually for project organization.
- Frontend never talks directly to MongoDB.
- Frontend only talks to backend API.

## Run

```bash
npm install
npm start
```
